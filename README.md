#       STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


### Description:
  I did a simple web application for viewing and editing student details and user details.
             I have used HTML,CSS for UI creation and python language with backend framework 'flask'.
             For DBMS, I used PHP database.


#### Technologies I have used 
- python
- mysql
- flask

#### Walkthrough through my code

  This is a simple web application where there are two users
  - Admin
  - User
  
  
  Both of them have to login to use the SMS system.


  **Admin :**

  Admin can view both the students details present and also the user details who use this SMS system.
  To view user details, admin has to login.



  **User :**

  The users of this system can only view the students details.


In my database I have created 2 tables to store all the user and student details including the user password.


I have created navigation bar which contains the following tabs-
  - Home
  - Master
  - Administrator



Using html list features, I have created the navigation bar and when the user hovers over the tab, it changes color
And both master and administrator tabs have drop-down menu.
